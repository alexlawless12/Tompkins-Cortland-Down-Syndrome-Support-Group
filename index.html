        <p>Due to COVID-19, many of our in-person events are cancelled for the time being. But here is an example of
          what we usually do! Check out more of our previous events on our <a href="about.html">About Us</a> page!</p>
        <p>The holiday season is coming up! Some families in our group usually like to get together and throw a
          Christmas
          party! Here, some of our kids get the opportunity to get a visit from Santa Claus! Let's hope he can visit
          this Winter.</p>
