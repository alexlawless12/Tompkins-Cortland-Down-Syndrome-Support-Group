The deliberately paced scenes feature classical music by great composers (such as Haydn and Mozart) integrated with puppets, live action, and computer animation. Early learning words scroll across the screen with voice-overs available in three language tracks.

Baby Neptune™ exposes little ones to the wonders of water in their world -- whether they're stomping in the rain, splashing in the bathtub, playing "catch me if you can" with the tide on the beach, or "meeting" the fascinating creatures that live in rivers, lakes and oceans. Overflowing with captivating undersea footage and live-action visuals of delightful puppet shows, toys, and happy children, this fun-filled exploration of "water, water everywhere" also features the Water Music of George Frideric Handel to accompany you and your little one on your own interactive voyage of discovery!
