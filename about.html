          What We Do
        </h2>
      <p>The Down Syndrome Support Group of Tompkins-Cortland Area is dedicated to helping families with children with
        Down Syndrome connect with other families. We share stories and advice, and build community with one another
        through planned events. Some of these include meetups at the park with our children, holiday themed events, or
        mom
        night outs. If you are interested in connecting with someone from the group, join our mailing list to learn
        more.
